This is a small WebGL application demonstrating all the terrible things you can do with WebGL & Javascript when you have a little - but not too much - skill and not any idea what to do with your ~~life~~ code.

## Play

[Play here](https://jani-nykanen.github.io/js-racing-webgl-demo/dist/)

(or if your browser supports es6 modules, [here](https://jani-nykanen.github.io/js-racing-webgl-demo/). No difference in the code, although the latter one might be more up-to-date.)

## "Building"

Closure compiler (version something) is included in this repo, to make the building easier

Run `dist.sh` to build a zip containing the distributable version of the application, without es6 modules. Note that since I use libraries that are not compatible with es6 modules, I couldn't use advanced compilation option of Closure compling.

## Libraries used

The following libraries were used

[webgl-obj-loaded](https://github.com/frenchtoast747/webgl-obj-loader)

[glMatrix](http://glmatrix.net)

Thank you for the developers of those libraries.

## Future

I might come back to this project once I figure out what to do with it
